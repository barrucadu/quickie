Ramshackle Hut

You are standing inside your ramshackle wooden hut. The squalor here has
replaced the comfort and grandeur of your former royal palace. In one corner
near the north door leading to your garden lies the pile of straw you use as
a bed. Fixed in place by an unknown magic, next to a small table, is a wooden
mockery of your former throne. The main door to the east leads outside to a
road.

You can see:
  a small wooden box of matches sitting on the table (2)

>
Dirt Patch

This patch of dirt and weeds bears no comparison to the lush gardens and
lawns of your former palace; you know that the dry cracked earth here will
bear no more fruit. A breeze from the west brings the stagnant odour of a
once lively pond.

You can see:
  a rusty old lamp lying discarded on the ground (1)

Dirt Path North

You are standing on a dirt path running north-south carved out of the rock by
millennia of foot traffic. To the west is the squalid hut that you call home.
The sheer cliff face of a mountain range lies to the east and continues into
the distance. The path leads north up a steep slope to a high plateau and
downhill to a small forest.

>
Dirt Path South

You are standing at a junction. The path north continues along the sheer
cliff and leads to a high plateau. Directly south you can see the tangled
trees and vines of a small forest. In the distance, to the west, you can see
the small village that you now call home.

>
Forest

Vines laced between dense tree growth filter the meagre light shining through
the canopy above you. A carpet of soft green moss covers the ground.

You can see:
  a stick of dynamite concealed in the hollow of an old tree (3)

Forest Clearing

The tangle of trees, bushes and vines parts here to form a small clearing. In
the centre of the clearing a small pool containing a shiny dark ooze flows
from deep underground. Evidence of a recent party is strewn about.
